Dear fellow human,
Dear extra-terrestrial visitor,

I am excited to welcome you to my public GitHub repository.
There are a few things I would like to tell you about myself and the things you will see before you start to browse:
-	My CV and a short story on how and why I became a software developer can be found on my webpage :  

-	The technologies I am most familiar with so far are:

    -	HTML / CSS3 / JS
    -	React / React-Redux
    -	Node.JS / npm
    -	Styled Components
    -	SASS 
    -	Python
    -	Django / Django REST
    -	Git
    -	Docker

-	My fields of interest are:
	- Frontend  development.
    - Science (Geology, Geography and most recently Microscopy)
    -	Outdoor stuff (if it’s something that happens in the mountains, I will be happy to chat about it)
    -	Food and Wine and the craft and art behind it.
    - Sharing thoughts and good times with other people and the extra-terrestrials once they are here.

-	It would be great to get in touch and collaborate on many projects, so please feel free to message me here or on LinkedIn

-	My journey to software development is a rather new one, so please excuse if the amount of code in here seams to be small…. There is more to come soon.
